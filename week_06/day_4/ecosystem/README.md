# Inheritance Lab

Create your own inheritance chain for modelling various types of animal.

Your base class should be Animal, and should have methods for eat() and breathe().

Create a subclass of Animal called Mammal. Mammals should have a talk() method.

Create two further subclasses of Mammal: Human and Chimpanzee. They should have a walk() method.

Make each method return a suitable string. Check that you can create a human and a chimpanzee object, and make sure that they can each eat, breathe, walk, and talk.
